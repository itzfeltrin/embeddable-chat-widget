- üé® Customizable styles and behavior

## Installation

**Via npm:**

```sh
npm install embeddable-chat-widget
```

**Or via pnpm:**

```sh
pnpm add embeddable-chat-widget
```

## Usage

### As a React Component

```tsx
import "@itzfeltrin/embeddable-chat-widget/dist/style.css";
import { Widget } from "@itzfeltrin/embeddable-chat-widget";

function App() {
  return <Widget openRouterKey="YOUR_API_KEY" />;
}
```

## Customizing Brand Colors

To customize the brand colors of the chat widget, you can define CSS variables in your stylesheet. Add variables ranging from `--color-brand-50` to `--color-brand-950` to override the default color palette. For example:

```css
:root {
  --color-brand-50: #f2f7fb;
  --color-brand-100: #d8e9f4;
  --color-brand-200: #b2d4ea;
  --color-brand-300: #7fb8dc;
  --color-brand-400: #4c9bce;
  --color-brand-500: #0071ba;
  --color-brand-600: #00609e;
  --color-brand-700: #004f82;
  --color-brand-800: #00385d;
  --color-brand-900: #002137;
  --color-brand-950: #00101b;
}
```

Place these variables in your global CSS to apply your custom brand colors to

```html
<!-- React and ReactDOM (required for the widget) -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@19.1.1/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@19.1.1/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>

/>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@itzfeltrin/embeddable-chat-widget@latest/dist/embeddable-chat-widget.iife.js"></script>

<script>
  ChatWidget.mount({
    selector: "#root",
    openRouterKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    colorPalette: {
      50: "#f2f7fb",
      100: "#d8e9f4",

## My approach

I think this was a really fun and different task ‚Äî different in the sense that I‚Äôve never done anything like it as part of an interview process before. It was fun most of the time‚Ä¶ except when I couldn‚Äôt get the widget to build in external React projects.

One thing that caught my attention right away in the instructions was "Install and use the widget on a sample HTML page." So my first idea was to create the package and make it an IIFE available via a <script> tag ‚Äî which I did. It was working great until I decided to also export it for EJS so I could use it in another React project. That‚Äôs when I ran into a ton of bugs, spent way too much time on them, and somehow broke the script tag version entirely. Right now, the <script> tag works fine if you target version 0.0.17 of the widget.

Regarding the actual code, I didn‚Äôt face too many issues to be honest. I used the stack I‚Äôm most comfortable with and had a great DX overall. The UI turned out pretty good in the end (IMHO), and I‚Äôm happy with it. A lot of the packages I pulled in definitely aren‚Äôt necessary for a project this small, but I figured this was the perfect time to show you the tools I like working with.

I ran out of time and wasn‚Äôt able to add tests (classic), so that would be the next thing I‚Äôd do. I‚Äôd also like to add some animations ‚Äî probably using Framer Motion (yep, another library).

For the LLM, I went with OpenRouter. It‚Äôs not an actual LLM, but more like a wrapper around many of them, such as GPT-3.5, which is what I used here. If I had more time, I‚Äôd set up my own backend to connect with it so I wouldn‚Äôt have to put keys in the frontend. That backend could also handle extras like real authentication, user sessions, conversation history, maybe even a way to store context for returning users.
